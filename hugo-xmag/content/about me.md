Thank you for visiting my blog.

I am a statistician working on child mortality at UNICEF. Before joining UNICEF I worked on environmental epidemiology at Mount Sinai Hospital and before that on urban science at NYU Marron Institute. I have lived in New York since 2014. 
  
I started my old blog in 2018 to keep a record of my work and share experience in R programming. Later I upgraded to this one, which is created by R `Blogdown`.
