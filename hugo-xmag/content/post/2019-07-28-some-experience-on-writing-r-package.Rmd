Although [**'SHAPforxgboost'**](https://github.com/liuyanguu/SHAPforxgboost) is not a package too complicated, it took me some time to get the package pass all the cran check. Now (Aug.03,2019) it is available on [**cran**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SHAPforxgboost/index.html). Install by either  

```{r}
install.packages("SHAPforxgboost")
```

or  

```{r}
devtools::install_github("liuyanguu/SHAPforxgboost")
```

Use the 'usethis' package [https://usethis.r-lib.org/](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) to set up the structure of the package. 

# Some of my own experience

## On description

Single quote packages in both Title and Description fields. For example: "This package uses the SHAP values output from **'xgboost'**".

* It is unnecessary to add any **Depends** in the **DESCRIPTION** besides `R (>= 3.3.0)`.

* The **Imports** part in the **DESCRIPTION** won't impact what you import into NAMESPACE in the code (although they are both named _import_).  The NAMESPACE is defined by using `@import` to import packages and functions in the R code. What you import into NAMESPACE are what really matters. But you should also keep the record aligned in the **DESCRIPTION** as cran will check it.

*How the DESCRIPTION looks like on cran:*

## Namespace

### load vs attach

* If you have `@import ggplot2` anywhere in the R code, the "`ggplot2`" package will be **loaded** (but not **attached**) and your functions can use `ggplot2`. Your package knows to search in the **namespace** of `ggplot2`, but you cannot run functions from `ggplot2` without typing `library(ggplot2)`. This is the difference between **attach** and **load** as discussed in Hadley's "R" package book: loading the package won't put its functions in the search path, but attaching will.

  + I.e., when others **load and attach** your package, they can use your functions depending on `ggplot2` but they cannot use the functions from the `ggplot2` package unless they **load and attach** `ggplot2` by `library(ggplot2)`.

  + If you put `ggplot2` in **Depends** in the **DESCRIPTION**, `library(yourPackage)` would load and attach `ggplot2` --- same as doing `library(ggplot2)` --- generally speaking you don't need to do so.

* If you name a function like `plot.shap.summary` it would be documented automatically as S3 method even if you wrote `@export plot.shap.summary` (By the way, must export the full function name, otherwise, it would become an S3 method in the namespace). Don't name function this way to avoid confusion with S3method. For example, I changed the name to `shap.plot.summary`.

## Documentation  

* `@example R/example/sample1.R` will attach **sample1.R** in the folder "R/example/" to the documentation of the function. If you write out the samples directly in the function code, you use @example**s** instead of @example.  

* All the function parameters should be documented using `@param`.  

## Potential problems when checking the package  

* You cannot have things like a line break __`"\n"`__ in the documentation. It will give a warning of "unknown macro", and will actually cause error when you try to download and build the package from github.

* When checking the package, there will be notes saying that "no visible binding for global variable". To remove such notes, adding anywhere in the script:
```{r }
if(getRversion() >= "2.15.1")  {
  utils::globalVariables(c(".", "rfvalue", "value", "values complained")) # all the variables complained
  }
```

* All the code scripts go into the **R/** folder. I think it seems OK to leave undocumented functions in a separate script as long as they are internally called.


# Some nice suggestions from the CRAN editors when submitting the package

Lots of thanks to Dr. Ligges and Dr. Herbrandt for their patient advice. 

* In the description, write package names, software names and API names in single quotes (e.g. 'Python'). The Title field should be in title case. The description should not start with package name or "This package". 
  
* Please ensure that you do not use more than 2 cores in your examples.
Is there any reason why the number of core to use is not an argument of 
e.g. `xgboost.fit()`?  

* Please replace `cat()` by `message()` or `warning()` in your functions (except 
for `print()` and `summary()` functions). Messages and warnings can be 
suppressed if needed.
