<p>The 2024 National K-12 Grades Championship attracted a total of 2,679 participants from 43 states. More than 1,000 participants came from New York, followed by Virginia with 250 participants and New Jersey with 218 participants.</p>

<h2>Fourth grade (age 9) is the most competitive, with nearly 350 participants.</h2>
<p>Grades 3, 4, and 5 have the highest number of participants, while Grade K has the fewest.</p>

<div id="th-grade-boasts-the-highest-average-rating-of-1600." class="section level2">
<h2>11th Grade boasts the highest average rating of 1,600.</h2>
<p>The average rating of more than 2,600 participants is 1,115, with a median of 1,062 and a standard deviation of 514. Ninety percent of the participants have ratings between 300 and 1,989.</p>
<p>The plot below shows the distribution of ratings across grades. The mean is indicated by the red bar, and the black bars in the boxplot represent the median.</p>

<div id="does-a-higher-rating-guarantee-a-higher-standing" class="section level2">
<h2>Does a higher rating guarantee a higher standing?</h2>
<p>Not necessarily! To standardize standings across grades, I calculated the percentile within each grade, scaling it from 0 to 100. The plot below illustrates the relationship between rating and percentile, with colors representing different grades.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the correlation between rating and percentile is relatively weak. While it is statistically significant due to the large sample size, the R-squared value (from a fitted linear regression) is only 0.48. This suggests that the correlation isn’t as strong as one might assume. The red lines represent a LOESS (locally estimated scatterplot smoothing) curve, providing a non-linear fit.</p>

<h2>Points Achieved vs. Rating</h2>
<p>Points achieved determined the final standings. This provides another perspective on the variation in ratings among participants who achieved the same number of points.</p>
<p><strong>The histogram at the top also shows that most kids achieved 3 or 4 points.</strong></p>
