<p>Since these figures are not directly available via Google search, I calculated them using the mid-year population estimates from the World Population Prospects (WPP) 2024:</p>
<p><strong>World Population:</strong> In 2024, the global population is estimated at 8.2 billion (8,162 million). The population is projected to peak in 2084 at 10.3 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Children Under 5 Years Old:</strong> The number of children under 5 is 647 million in 2024. This figure peaked in 2017 at 698 million and is projected to decline to 550 million by 2100.</p>
<p><strong>Children Aged 0–14 Years:</strong> The population of children aged 0–14 peaked in 2020 and stands at 2.0 billion in 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Children and Adolescents under 18:</strong> The population of those aged 0–17 years peaked in 2022 and stands at 2.4 billion (2,413 million) in 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Children and Adolescents under 20:</strong> The population of those aged 0–19 years is 2.7 billion (2,668 million) in 2024, which marks the peak year for this age group.</p>
<p><strong>Population Under 25 Years Old (0–24):</strong> The number of people aged 0–24 years is 3.3 billion in 2024. This population is expected to experience a slight increase and peak in 2030.</p>
