Thank you for visiting my blog.

I am a statistician focused on child mortality at UNICEF. Prior to my current role, I contributed to environmental epidemiology projects at Mount Sinai Hospital and engaged in urban science research at the NYU Marron Institute. I've been residing in New York since 2014.

In 2018, I launched a blog to document my projects and share insights from my experience with R programming. As my engagement with the blog and my audience grew, I transitioned to a more advanced platform created with R `Blogdown`, seeking to leverage its enhanced features for a better blogging experience.
